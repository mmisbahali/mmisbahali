I work on a variety of projects across aviation, mobility, and large-scale enterprise platforms.  
Many of these are proprietary or confidential — so I can’t share code, but I can tell you about what they **do** and the impact they’ve had 🚀

### 🏢 Enterprise Engineering Highlights

- ✈️ **Etihad Airways**: Built the core system for online check-in, ancillary services, and payments, powering millions of daily passengers
- 🧳 Designed scalable systems for passenger check-in & order management using NestJS, GraphQL, and microservices
- 📲 Led the backend engineering stream for Etihad’s new digital journey platform

### 🚘 Udrive

- Real-time fleet tracking and remote control system for the UAE's largest car-sharing platform
- Built and scaled IoT-based vehicle communication services using Node.js, Redis, and AWS
- Enabled instant onboarding, live car unlock, and pricing engine integration

### 🧪 Open-Source

- [`github-contrib-wall`](https://github.com/mmisbahali/github-contrib-wall): Mirrors real GitLab contributions onto GitHub with a commit replay strategy
- Actively building tools to bridge GitHub and enterprise version control environments

> **TL;DR**: Just because you can’t see the source doesn’t mean it didn’t ship. I make systems that scale, secure platforms that fly, and empower teams to go fast — the right way.
