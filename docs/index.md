# 👋 Welcome

I'm Misbah Ali — Software Engineering Manager by day, 🎸 musician by night, ✈️ globe-trotter on weekends.

- 💻 I build scalable systems & lead engineering teams.
- 🎵 I perform live and produce music.
- 🌍 I’ve traveled across Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East.

This is my digital hub — a mix of commits, chords, and culture.
